formula.js
==========

JavaScript implementation of Microsoft Excel formula functions.

This is a straight-forward fork of the [Crowd Process
fork](https://github.com/CrowdProcess/formula.js/) of
[formula.js](https://github.com/sutoiku/formula.js/). The Crowd Process fork is
notable primarily in that it features significantly improved error handling,
cuts down on dependencies and excludes functions which are not offered by
Microsoft Excel itself. This fork uses Webpack (like the original formula.js)
and features a current GitHub release, enabling it to be used with the
dependency management system Bower.
