formulajs
=========

JavaScript implementation of Microsoft Excel formula functions.

This is a straight-forward fork of the [Crowd Process
fork](https://github.com/CrowdProcess/formula.js/) of
[formula.js](https://github.com/sutoiku/formula.js/). The Crowd
Process fork is notable primarily for featuring significantly improved
error handling, cutting down on dependencies and excluding functions
which are not offered by Microsoft Excel itself.

This fork uses Webpack (like the original formula.js) and features a
package information file for the Bower dependency management system as
well as pre-built distribution files. There is also a fair number of
bug fixes.
