formulajs
=========

JavaScript implementation of Microsoft Excel formula functions.

This was forked from 
[davidpolberger fork](https://github.com/davidpolberger/formulajs) 
in October 2016 (although github fork graph doesn't show this anymore!?!?).
That fork was forked from the latest (as of that date) 
[CrowdProcess fork](https://github.com/CrowdProcess/formula.js/). 
That in turn was forked from the 
[root project](https://github.com/sutoiku/formula.js/)
19-Aug-2014.

According to davidpolberger: The CrowdProcess fork is notable primarily for featuring significantly improved
error handling, cutting down on dependencies and excluding functions
which are not offered by Microsoft Excel itself.  
This fork uses Webpack (like the original formula.js) and features a
package information file for the Bower dependency management system as
well as pre-built distribution files. There is also a fair number of
bug fixes.
